# SecurePass Manager

**[OFFICIAL WEBSITE!!!](https://edit-bossz.github.io/SecurePass_Manager/)**

This is a Python-based GUI application built for simple password management with no bs.
This project was originally developed in Python. It has been converted to an **.exe** by the very helpful tool [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

## Features

- **Modern Theming:** Uses `ttkbootstrap` for a responsive and modern UI.
- **System Theme Detection:** Automatically adapts to dark/light mode based on OS settings.
- **File Handling:** Allows users to open, save, and encrypt files. It allows **CSV** import/export.
- **Encryption Support:** Utilizes `cryptography.fernet` for secure data encryption.
